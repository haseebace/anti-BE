
1
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,003
Excuse me?

2
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:22,010
Excuse me, sir?

3
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,005
Excuse me?

4
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, come on.

5
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do you have a moment, sir?

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,005
I'm kind of in the middle of something here.
Yes? Thank you.

7
00:02:37,005 --> 00:02:38,014
I've come a long way for you, Franck.

8
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My name is Victor.

9
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hi.

10
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And you are....

11
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,005
You are Franck.

12
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:03,010
You are so much more than just a sheep, aren't you?

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh yeah? How would you know?

14
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,009
Look at you. You're an adventurer, Franck.

15
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:16,010
Just like me, you're... a lone wolf.

16
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Tell me, does one choose to be alone?

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, one doesn't.

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,006
One doesn’t even choose to be a wolf.

19
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Or does one?

20
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,008
Well, mister... err... Hector.

21
00:03:38,008 --> 00:03:39,010
Victor. Victor.

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don’t know what you’re on about but I'm just
a sheep minding its own business.

23
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,006
And I suggest you do the same.

24
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:51,010
No. No no no, Franck. Wait wait wait.

25
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No. This is not... the way.

26
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,005
Just give me one minute of your precious time.

27
00:03:58,005 --> 00:04:01,005
Precious time? Hehehe.

28
00:04:01,005 --> 00:04:03,005
Yeah just give me one minute.

29
00:04:03,005 --> 00:04:06,005
You would have one more minute, wouldn't you?

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay half. Half a minute.

31
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:29,003
I knew it.
I knew it.

32
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,010
You will not regret this.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The adventures you will have.

34
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,005
All the lives you've ever wanted.

35
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:41,007
All you’ve been missing.

36
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:45,010
Here. This is... the best product we have... in store.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Variable spin speed, excellent tumble performance...

38
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
...in one... handy... device. Squeaky clean.

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well this... this better be good.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Took me ages to tie that rope.

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
With my fucking hooves.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No more need for hooves.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No more sheepy business.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,005
Ho! Time flies.

45
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:16,007
Wait wait wait wait wait wait.

46
00:05:16,007 --> 00:05:17,015
How does this thing work?

47
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:20,010
I mean, how do I make it work?

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,005
No you don't.

49
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,010
I just turned it on for you.

50
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When can I go?

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Where can I go?

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
We will pick you up. Don't worry, just stay here.

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
In this exact place.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't move. Just wait.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's it?

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey!

57
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,010
Hey!

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,005
Wait, mister!

59
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:48,009
Eh, Casper!

60
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:50,010
Hector whatever!
